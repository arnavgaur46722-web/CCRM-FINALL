Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
ðŸ“– Project Overview
The Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a robust Java SE console-based application engineered to facilitate the comprehensive management of academic and administrative records for educational institutions. It provides a centralized platform for handling:

Student Management: Creation, modification, enrollment, unenrollment, and transcript generation.

Course Administration: Creation, modification, search, and assignment of instructors.

Enrollment & Grading: Recording of grades, computation of Grade Point Averages (GPA), and automated transcript generation.

File Utilities: Functionality for importing/exporting data via CSV, executing recursive backups, and generating various reports.

The application serves as a comprehensive showcase of advanced Java programming paradigms, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), modern NIO.2 File I/O, the Stream API, the Date/Time API, sophisticated Exception Handling, and strategic implementation of Design Patterns (Singleton, Builder).
